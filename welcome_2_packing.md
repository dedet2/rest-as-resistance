Subject: What to pack for onsen & winter Japan

Hi {{first_name}},

December in Japan is cool and crisp. Here’s a quick list:
- Layered warmth (base layer, sweater, coat)
- Easy on/off socks for temple visits
- Onsen kit (we provide: towels, modesty cover, hair wrap)
- Skin & hair care for winter dryness (we provide basics; bring favorites)

Accessibility notes: most days are gentle-paced; we have opt‑out culture.

With care,  
Team Incluu
